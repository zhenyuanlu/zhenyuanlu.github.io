title: Paper-based Device For Gastroenteritis Detection Integrated With Sample Preparation Cartridge
year: 2016
---

In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common and often deadly disease caused by several
diverse pathogens typically resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal cramping.1
Treatment decisions beyond oral rehydration therapy require advanced diagnostic testing by well-trained medical
personnel using costly instrumentation and facilities that are not always available in resource-poor settings. Thus,
a need remains for inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapid, portable and highly sensitive detection assays for
gastroenteritis.
