Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, are highly infectious agents
that cause acute gastroenteritis in both children and adults worldwide; yet, access to routine diagnostic tests remains limited. The
long-term goal of this project is to develop a rapid diagnostic system for detection of noroviruses that can be
employed at the point-of-need. Our approach capitalizes upon recent advances in the fabrication of low-cost
microfluidic devices using patterned paper as an instrument-free platform for sophisticated biological assays.
These devices are known as microfluidic paper analytical devices (Î¼PADs) or two-dimensional paper networks
(2DPNs), 2 In these devices, capillary action draws fluids through the channels eliminating the need for
expensive pumps and fluid handling equipment found in traditional microfluidic devices
