  Our topic focuses on the trade flow of a country and we introduce a centralized degree which could best describe trade population. The centralized degree reflects that the person who is the most in his or her group or who stands at the center of attention (Bavelas, 1950). In our project, we build up a model to predict how factors make an impact on centralized degree, we found eight main factors (population, child mortality per 1000, life expectancy, number of battle per year, war role, death in the war, war duration, outcome of the war) could affect the centralized degree of a country.
