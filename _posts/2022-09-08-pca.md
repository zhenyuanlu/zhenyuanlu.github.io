**NOTE:**
Citations, footnotes, and code blocks do not display correctly in the dark mode since distill does not support the dark mode by default.
If you are interested in correctly adding dark mode support for distill, please open [a discussion](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/discussions) and let us know.

## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

### Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="python">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

```python
import numpy from np
@decorator(param=1)
super(FFNN, self).__init__()
self.V = nn.Linear(inp, hid)
# self.g = nn.Tanh()
self.g = nn.ReLU()
self.W = nn.Linear(hid, out)
self.log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=0)
# Initialize weights according to a formula due to Xavier Glorot.
nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.V.weight)
nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.W.weight)

@decorator(param=1)
def f(x):
    """
    Syntax Highlighting Demo
    @param x Parameter

    Semantic highlighting:
    Generated spectrum to pick colors for local variables and parameters:
     Color#1 SC1.1 SC1.2 SC1.3 SC1.4 Color#2 SC2.1 SC2.2 SC2.3 SC2.4 Color#3
     Color#3 SC3.1 SC3.2 SC3.3 SC3.4 Color#4 SC4.1 SC4.2 SC4.3 SC4.4 Color#5
    """

    def nested_func(y):
        print(y + 1)

    s = ("Test", 2+3, {'a': 'b'}, f'{x!s:{"^10"}}')   # Comment
    f(s[0].lower())
    nested_func(42)

class Foo:
    tags: List[str]

    def __init__(self: Foo):
        byte_string: bytes = b'newline:\n also newline:\x0a'
        text_string = u"Cyrillic Я is \u042f. Oops: \u042g"
        self.make_sense(whatever=1)

    def make_sense(self, whatever):
        self.sense = whatever

x = len('abc')
print(f.__doc__)
```

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).



{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look well in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight python %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}


***

#### Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="lu2022visualization"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work. <d-cite key="Shalev"></d-cite>

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.
