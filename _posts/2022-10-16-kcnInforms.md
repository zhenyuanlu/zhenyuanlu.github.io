## Abstract

The typical manual literature review technique is becoming increasingly difficult as pain research expands fast. To assist researchers, this work creates an automated, systematic knowledge mapping and suggests future prospects for the pain literature. The use of network and graph data science algorithms in systematic literature reviews is a promising method. They find links between articles and uncover hidden insights from massive amounts of interrelated data. This study collects keywords from 264,560 pain research publications, constructs a keyword co-occurrence network (KCN) based on these terms, then evaluates the KCN using data science methods. Our primary findings show that I the number of new keywords in articles has increased by a factor of twenty in the previous two decades, and ii) the most important rising ideas are machine learning, acute pain, and pain management.
